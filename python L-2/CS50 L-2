#why use elif over if or whats the difference bw them
#elif is faster but you wont notice the difference in smaller programs but in longer program its better

#IF
x=int(input("choose x "))
y=int(input("choose y "))
if(x>y):
    print("x is greater than y")
if(x<y):
    print("x is less than y")
if(x==y):
    print("x is equals to y")

#(Notice how you are providing a series of if statements. First,the first if statement is
# evaluated. Then, the second if statement runs its evaluation.Finally, the last if statement
# runs its evaluation. This flow of decisions is called “control flow.”even if the first if statement satisfies
#it would still evaluate the rest of the if statements)

#(Notice how the use of elif allows the program to make fewer decisions,therefore its fast
# First, the if statement is evaluated. If this statement is found to be true, all the elif statements
# will not be run at all. However, if the if statement is evaluated and found to be false,
# the first elif will be evaluated. If this is true, it will not run the final evaluation)
#THEREFORE,dont use if again and again use it the first timme and use elif for the rest of the program

#PARITY FUNCTION
# every integer can be writen using 1 and 0 in the binary system.ex: 5=101 in binary parity basically
# refers to how many 1 are there in the binary system of any number.ex: parity of 5 is 2 cuz 101 has 2 one
# if the number of 1 in the binary representation is even then its even parity and odd number of
# 1 means odd parity. ex: 5 has two 1 and 2 is even so 5 is even parity.
